# Chip 8

A chip 8 interpreter

## Why?

It was an interesting project of reasonable scale I could use to start learning Rust.
This was my first project in Rust and while I've updated it a few times, it remains largely as it was with minor refactoring.

## Dependencies

You'll need to add SDL2.dll to the top level directly.
You'll also need to download ROM files.

## Usage

```
chip8 <ROM path>
```
